We've used the following directory structure, to allow inheritance between solutions:

Q1_1, Q1_2 and Q3:
    Each folder contains a go.py file, that needs to be ran from root directory
    e.g., python Q1_1\go.py

Q2 - Q2\2.ipynb - Jupyter notebook
Q3 - Q3\3.ipynb - Jupyter notebook

In question 1.1, after parsing, we didn't recreated the percolated rules back to unary. This is the reason for the lower performance scores.
