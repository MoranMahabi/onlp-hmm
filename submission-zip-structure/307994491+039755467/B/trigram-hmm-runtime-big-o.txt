Initialization step:
 O(1) - as the best probability that we are in -1 time-step and (prev_state, curr_state) = (BOS, BOS) is 1

Recursion step:
 External loop - O(S) iterations - a pass over each sentence
 Internal loops - O(L^3) iterations - for finding the best transition according to Trigram HMM
 Together - O(S * L^3)

Termination step:
 O(L^2) - calculating best path back-pointer according to Trigram HMM
 O(L) - for building the result

All together - O(S * L^3)
